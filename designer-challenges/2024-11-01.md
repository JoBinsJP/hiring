# UI/UX Design Challenge

This design challenge is divided into two parts:

1. Design a User Interface
2. Showcase a Case Study

## Part I: Design a User Interface
**Preferred tool:** Figma

**Submission Deadline:** 18 September 2024

### Task: Job Seeker Vacancy Management System

**Context:**  
Design an intuitive interface for a job seeker vacancy management system that streamlines the process of reviewing and responding to job vacancies shared by recruiting agents. The platform should enable candidates to easily view vacancy details, accept or decline application requests, and track deadlines, making the job application process faster and more organized.

### Requirements:

1. **Clear and User-Friendly Interface**  
   Create a visually clear, intuitive, and easy-to-navigate interface for job seekers. The design should prioritize usability and provide a seamless user experience.

2. **Vacancy List View**  
   Design a vacancy list page that displays all vacancies shared by recruiting agents. Include essential vacancy information and status indicators (viewed/unviewed, accepted/rejected, expiring soon).

3. **Vacancy Detail View**  
   Incorporate a detailed view for each vacancy, either as a separate page or a popup, allowing users to access full vacancy information.

4. **Action Time Limit Visualization**  
   Implement a visual representation of the two-week time limit for each vacancy, clearly indicating the remaining time for candidates to respond.

5. **Filtering and Sorting Options**  
   Design filtering and sorting functionalities to allow users to organize vacancies based on various criteria (e.g., viewed/unviewed, application status, expiration date).

6. **Accessibility Considerations**  
   Ensure the interface is accessible to users with different levels of technical proficiency. Consider accessibility guidelines, such as legible text, appropriate color contrast, and user-friendly interactions.

7. **Design System**  
   Create a comprehensive design system that establishes consistent visual and interaction patterns throughout the interface.

8. **First-Time User Experience**  
   Design a feature guide or onboarding process for first-time users accessing the system through the URL sent by a recruiting agent.

### Justification:
Justify your design decisions and explain how your design solution simplifies the vacancy management process, leading to a better user experience for job seekers.
